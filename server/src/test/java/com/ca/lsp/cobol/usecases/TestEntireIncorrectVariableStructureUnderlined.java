/**
 * This test checks that parser can find and underline an incorrect variable structure. Here CHILD1
 * is not a part of PARENT because they are on the same level, but on the line 8 they called the way
 * if CHILD1 was a part of PARENT1 structure. It is incorrect, so CHILD1 should be underlined. On
 * the line 10 there is a non-defined variable called as a part of a structure, that should produce
 * two errors with intersecting positions. Check also that the multiple whitespaces collapsed in the
 * error message.
